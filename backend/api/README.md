# Running the App

## Pre-requisites

1. Python version 3.12.3 (I recommend you install it with pyenv)
2. Poetry installed
3. Virtual environment activated with `poetry shell`
4. `poetry install` in `homely/backend/api`

Assuming you are at this project's root directory:
```bash
flask --app api run --debug
```
